Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man is made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood, and skin and bone
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons, and what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I went to the mine
I loaded sixteen ton of number nine coal
And the straw-boss said, "Well, bless my soul"
